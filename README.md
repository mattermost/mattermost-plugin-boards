## Try Focalboard

### Mattermost Plugin

After downloading and installing the plugin in the System Console, select the menu in the top left corner and select **Boards**. Access the latest releases of the focalboard plugin by downloading the `mattermost-plugin-focalboard.tar.gz` file from the releases in this repository: <https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/releases>


### API Docs

Boards API docs can be found over at <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/blob/main/server/swagger/docs/html/index.html>

### Getting started

Our [developer guide](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/more-info/focalboard/mattermost-boards-setup-guide/) has detailed instructions on how to set up your development environment for the **Mattermost boards plugin**. You can also join the [~Focalboard community channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/focalboard) to connect with other developers.

Clone [mattermost-server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server) into sibling directory.

You also want to have the environment variable `MM_DEBUG"true"` set, otherwise the plugin
will be compiled for Linux, Windows, and Darwin ARM64 and x64 architecture every single time. Setting
the `MM_DEBUG` to `true` makes the plugin compile and build only for the OS and architecture
you are building on.

In your Mattermost configuration file, ensure that `PluginSettings.EnableUploads` is set to `true`, and `FileSettings.MaxFileSize` is
set to a large enough value to accept the plugin bundle (eg `256000000`).

### Building the plugin

Run the following command in the plugin repository to prepare a compiled, distributable plugin ZIP file:

```bash
make dist
```

After a successful build, a `.tar.gz` file in the `/dist` folder will be created which can be uploaded to Mattermost. To avoid having to manually install your plugin, deploy your plugin using one of the following options.

##### Building in Dev Mode

Set the following environment variables to true before running `make dist`-

1. MM_DEBUG

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can
enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying
your plugin. Edit your server configuration as follows:

```
{
    "ServiceSettings": {
        ...
        "EnableLocalMode": true,
        "LocalModeSocketLocation": "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket"
     }
}
```

and then deploy your plugin:

```bash
make deploy
```

If developing a plugin with a web app, watch for changes and deploy those automatically:

```bash
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
make watch-plugin
```



### Unit testing

Before checking in commits, run `make ci`, which is similar to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` workflow and includes:

* **Server unit tests**: `make server-test`
* **Web app ESLint**: `cd webapp; npm run check`
* **Web app unit tests**: `cd webapp; npm run test`
